Binary Dictionary Turing Machine

Registers:
- Addr: Next logic address

Memory Layout:
0: [ symbol | shiftr | br0_addr | br1_addr ]
1: [ symbol | shiftr | br0_addr | br1_addr ]
...

brx_addr - the next state logic address if the Sym holds x
shiftr - if 1 the tape is shifted to right, otherwise shifted to left

The machine is a single-cycle machine and it always start by the initial current state(i.e. state1).
