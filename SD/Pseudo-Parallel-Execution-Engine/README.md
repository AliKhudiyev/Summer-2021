# Pseudo-Parallel Execution Engine (PPEE)

PPEE is an engine to develop and execute programs which expose high degree of spatial parallelism. The engine is also developed for experimental purposes and therefore, should not be considered as a well-developed piece of software. The idea behind implementation is to run everything fully sequentially while exposing the results to a user in a manner that a fully-parallel execution of the same program would. The PPEE is developed to be used later on for experimenting some of my hypothesis mentioned in the FRS.
