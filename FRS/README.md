# Fundamental Reasoning System

This is a project in which I usually think about AI and try to implement some of my theories/hypothesis when necessary. I would call it an obligation-free research project since there is neither demand nor expectation by any university or company and I am free to do and lead the process however I wish. In such type of projects of mine, I usually try to gain a deep view or perspective on the subject that I am thinking about and this usually leads me to obtain either effective or diverse/incomplete results. At the end of the day, I mostly believe, this is a WIN-WIN situation for me anyways... :)

## Research & Developement

**Note:** The shared document describes my personal thoughts on AI and it is still a draft version. If you ever had an interest to read it then I would recommend you to remember 2 things beforehand: *it's written by me* and *no big expectations*.
